# CS193P - Developing Apps for iOS


### Fall 2013 - Developing iOS 7 Apps for iPhone and iPad
Course available in [iTunes U][fall2013].

The hardest part of doing iOS development, if you don't already have a job doing iOS development, is keeping up with the
drastic updates to Xcode and iOS with every yearly release of iOS.  I find watching these courses as extremely helpful for
the casual iOS developer (like me).  This repository is just my sandbox for doing the assignments.  If you want to watch
the videos and get all of the course materials then go to the iTunes U link to download them all.



There are previous courses available in iTunes U for earlier versions of iOS.
